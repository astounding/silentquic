//! Task 11: end-to-end cloaking / silence integration suite.
//!
//! This is the headline proof that a real, socket-bound [`Server`] is invisible
//! to unauthorized peers and works normally for authorized ones. Every silence
//! case here sends REAL UDP bytes at a REAL bound server and then asserts the
//! sender's socket receives nothing within a bounded timeout — a timeout
//! elapsing is the pass condition for a silence case, never its absence of
//! effort. The happy-path case is the mirror: a real [`Client`] with the
//! correct PSK must connect and echo data end-to-end.
//!
//! Cases (see individual `#[tokio::test]`s below):
//!  1. `junk_scan_is_silent` — 100 random/varied-length UDP payloads, each
//!     from a distinct source socket so the bulk actually reach the DCID
//!     pre-filter rather than being eaten by the per-source rate limiter.
//!  2. `stock_quic_initial_is_silent` — a stock-QUIC-shaped long header with a
//!     random (non-selector) DCID.
//!  3. `replay_is_silent` — a valid-PSK, fresh selector DCID sent twice; the
//!     second (replayed) delivery must be silently dropped.
//!  4. `stale_freshness_is_silent` — a selector DCID built with a freshness
//!     far outside the acceptance window.
//!  5. `wrong_psk_is_silent` — an authorized-shaped DCID keyed with the WRONG
//!     PSK, both as a raw crafted datagram AND via a real `Client::connect`
//!     configured with the wrong PSK (must return `Err`/time out).
//!  6. `happy_path_connects_and_echoes` — correct-PSK `Client::connect`
//!     succeeds, opens a stream, and echoes a payload end-to-end.
