//! Regression guard for driver reaping of LOCALLY-initiated connection closes.
//!
//! quinn-proto 0.11's `Connection::close()` only arms the connection's close
//! timer; when that timer fires the connection moves to `Drained` WITHOUT ever
//! setting quinn-proto's internal `error` field. Consequently `Connection::poll()`
//! never yields `Event::ConnectionLost` for a *locally*-initiated close (only a
//! *remotely*-initiated close — receiving a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, a transport
//! error, or a reset — sets that field).
//!
//! Before the fix, this meant a server-side `Connection::close()` left the
//! connection's driver-side state in `Driver::connections`/`Driver::surfaced`
//! forever, its `ConnectionHandle` never freed in our bookkeeping even though
//! quinn-proto's own endpoint slab had already reclaimed it (via
//! `EndpointEventInner::Drained`). Eventually quinn-proto reused a
//! `ConnectionHandle` that still had a stale `surfaced` entry, and the collision
//! wedged `Server::accept` forever — reproducibly around ~32 connect/accept/close
//! cycles against one long-lived `Server`.
//!
//! The fix reaps a connection once `state.conn.is_drained()` (the terminal state
//! reached by BOTH the remote path — already caught by `progress.lost` — and the
//! local-close path) in addition to `progress.lost`, in the core's servicing pass
//! (`quietquic_proto::endpoint::Endpoint`), which both the server (`src/server.rs`)
//! and client (`src/client.rs`) drivers now pump.
//!
//! This test drives one long-lived `Server` through enough server-side-close
//! cycles to exceed the historical ~32-cycle collision point, wrapping every step
//! in `tokio::time::timeout` so a reaping regression fails as a bounded panic
//! rather than hanging the whole test binary.
