A cloaked QUIC transport library, in Rust: a server built on `quietquic` is
**invisible to network scanners** — it emits zero bytes in response to any
packet that doesn't prove possession of a valid pre-shared key (PSK) — and its
traffic **camouflages as ordinary QUIC v1/HTTP3**, blending into the large
volume of legitimate internet QUIC. Authentication and per-client key
*selection* are folded into the QUIC `Initial` packet itself, so unauthorized
traffic is rejected before any connection state is allocated and before any
byte is sent back.

`quietquic` is a standalone transport library. It contains no application
logic; it exposes raw authenticated bidirectional byte streams for a caller
(e.g. a backup tool, a config-push agent, anything that wants a QUIC pipe that
doesn't advertise itself to the internet) to frame however it likes.

> **Release status:** `0.1.0-alpha.2` is an experimental preview. The protocol
> has extensive automated tests but has not yet received an independent
> cryptographic review. Do not treat it as production-hardened.

## Architecture: two crates, pick your I/O model

| Crate | What it is | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **`quietquic-proto`** (`proto/`) | The **sans-IO core**. No I/O, no async runtime, no threads, and it never blocks or reads the clock — you own the socket and pass `now` in. | You have your own event loop, or you're embedding via FFI |
| **`quietquic`** (repo root) | A thin **tokio** wrapper over the core: owns a UDP socket, runs a driver task, exposes `async` `Server`/`Client`/`Connection`/`Stream`. | Your application is already `async`/`.await` |

This mirrors `quinn-proto`/`quinn`, and it exists because the two I/O models are
mutually exclusive: tokio owns the thread and parks in `epoll`/`kqueue` when
idle, so it cannot be embedded in a hand-rolled loop that polls with a zero
timeout and has other work to do between passes. Layering serves both instead of
compromising either.

`proto/examples/poll_loop.rs` is the reference for the sans-IO path — a single
thread, non-blocking sockets, nothing that parks — and it is run in CI so it
cannot rot.

**The silence invariant is stronger in the core.** *A datagram that fails the
cloaking pre-filter queues nothing to send.* `handle_datagram` returns before
such a packet ever reaches quinn-proto, so there is nothing for `poll_transmit`
to hand back: an embedder driving the state machine by hand **cannot** reply to
an unauthorized peer, even by mistake. Invisibility is a property of the API
rather than of the caller's control flow.

verbatim in substance — read it before deploying.

## Quickstart

### 1. Generate a PSK

The PSK is 32 random bytes, hex-encoded (64 hex characters), shared out of
band between server and client — the same trust model as an SSH
`authorized_keys` entry or a WireGuard PSK.

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 2. Server config (`server.toml`)

The server holds the listen address and the full set of authorized clients
(`client_id -> psk`). IDs and PSKs must both be unique. The server derives the
authenticated `client_id` from the PSK that admitted the connection. `chmod
600` the file — it is cleartext secret material on disk.

```toml
listen = "0.0.0.0:443"

[[clients]]
client_id = "backup-host-1"
psk = "3f9a1c...<64 hex chars>...b2"

[[clients]]
client_id = "backup-host-2"
psk = "7e02dd...<64 hex chars>...11"
```

### 3. Client config (`client.toml`)

Each client holds a local descriptive label, its PSK, and the server it dials.
The client-side `client_id` is not sent on the wire; the server identifies the
peer from its unique configured PSK entry.

```toml
client_id = "backup-host-1"
psk = "3f9a1c...<64 hex chars>...b2"
server = "203.0.113.7:443"
```

### 4. Server: bind and accept connections

```rust
use quietquic::config::{FileSource, SecretSource};
use quietquic::server::Server;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let secrets = FileSource::new("server.toml").load()?;
    let mut server = Server::bind(secrets).await?;
    println!("listening on {}", server.local_addr());

    while let Some(conn) = server.accept().await {
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            // Only ever fires for a peer that proved PSK possession and
            // completed the QUIC handshake — unauthorized peers never reach
            // this point at all.
            println!("authenticated client: {:?}", conn.client_id());
            let mut stream = conn.accept_stream().await.expect("accept stream");
            let msg = stream.read_to_end(1024 * 1024).await.expect("read");
            println!("got {} bytes from {}", msg.len(), conn.remote_address());
        });
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### 5. Client: connect and open a stream

```rust
use quietquic::client::Client;
use quietquic::config::ClientConfigFile;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let text = std::fs::read_to_string("client.toml")?;
    let cfg: ClientConfigFile = toml::from_str(&text)?;

    let conn = Client::connect(cfg).await?;
    let mut stream = conn.open_stream().await?;
    stream.write_all(b"hello over a cloaked pipe").await?;
    stream.finish().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The primary surface is `Server::bind` / `Server::accept`, `Client::connect`,
`Connection::open_stream` / `accept_stream` / `close`, and the stream methods
`read(max)` / `write_all` / `finish` / `read_to_end(limit)` / `split`.
`Connection::client_id` identifies an accepted peer on the server. Framing on
top of these raw byte streams is left to the caller.

For full-duplex or untrusted-size traffic, split the stream and read
incrementally:

```rust,no_run
# async fn relay(stream: quietquic::conn::Stream) -> Result<(), quietquic::conn::ConnError> {
let (mut recv, mut send) = stream.split();
let reader = async move {
    loop {
        let chunk = recv.read(16 * 1024).await?;
        if chunk.is_empty() {
            break;
        }
        println!("received {} bytes", chunk.len());
    }
    Ok::<_, quietquic::conn::ConnError>(())
};
let writer = async move {
    send.write_all(b"request").await?;
    send.finish().await
};
tokio::try_join!(reader, writer)?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

The underlying `quinn_proto::Connection` is reachable via
`Connection::quinn_connection()`, which returns a `QuinnHandle` exposing
bidirectional-stream commands (`open_bi` / `accept_bi`) routed through the same
driver channel the cloaking layer uses — so the cloaking/routing code does not
have to change to layer a higher-level protocol on top. Note that this is a
seam for a FUTURE direction, not a drop-in today: HTTP/3, for example, also
needs unidirectional streams (h3 uses uni streams for its control stream and
QPACK encoder/decoder), and the handle does not yet expose uni-stream commands.

## Threat Model

Stated plainly here so no operator over-trusts this library. (Reproduced from
the design spec, §3.)

### What quietquic defeats

- **Internet-wide active scanning** (nmap, zmap, masscan) and search engines
  (Shodan, Censys): the server never responds to an unauthorized probe, so it
  appears as a closed/filtered UDP port. UDP has no kernel-level handshake to
  refuse, so the silence is complete — no RST, no distinguishable timeout, no
  TLS alert.
- **Netflow / flow-log classification** and **casual DPI**: traffic looks like
  a normal QUIC connection to some IP on UDP/443.

### What quietquic does NOT defeat

- **Global passive traffic analysis.** Backups (or any bulk transfer) are
  large and periodic; the *volume and timing pattern* of traffic to a fixed
  endpoint leaks even when service identity and content do not. No
  packet-level trick hides this.
- **Sophisticated DPI that actively attempts `Initial` decryption on every
  flow.** In stock QUIC, the `Initial` packet is protected with keys derived
  from a *published* version salt plus the on-wire Destination Connection ID
  (DCID), so any observer can unseal it and read the TLS ClientHello. Because
  quietquic **re-keys the `Initial` with the PSK**, such an observer's unseal
  attempt produces garbage — revealing "QUIC whose Initial won't decrypt," an
  anomaly resembling an unknown/broken QUIC variant. This is the irreducible
  cost of folding authentication into the `Initial`; it cannot be avoided
  without surrendering auth secrecy. It is a non-issue against scanning and
  casual detection, and no packet-level design defeats an adversary already
  decrypting every QUIC `Initial` on the link.
- **Resource side-channel via a co-located service.** Even a silent server
  consumes CPU/memory to process-then-drop junk packets. An attacker flooding
  the host and watching an *unrelated* co-located service's latency can infer
  that something is doing per-packet crypto work. Mitigations (bounded,
  allocation-free reject path; cheap MAC compares before any expensive AEAD
  unseal; per-source and global rate limits) bound and flatten this channel
  but cannot close it.

  **Recommended deployment: run quietquic as the only service on its host.**

## Limitations / Not Yet Production-Hardened

These are known, deliberate boundaries of the current implementation —
surfaced here so users know exactly where the edges are, rather than
discovering them under load.

1. **Single-threaded driver.** Both the server and client each run a single
   sans-IO driver task that awaits `socket.send_to()` inline while pumping
   connections. This is a single-threaded throughput chokepoint: fine for a
   handful of concurrent clients (the expected backup-transport use case), but
   not tuned for high fan-out (hundreds+ of simultaneous connections on one
   server).
2. **`Stream::read_to_end(limit)` buffers up to the caller's explicit limit.**
   It returns `ConnError::ReadLimitExceeded` if the peer sends more. Interactive
   applications should still use `Stream::read(max)` or split the stream into
   independent receive/send handles and process data incrementally.
3. **Rate-limit parameters are compile-time constants**, not yet configurable
   via TOML. The per-source and global buckets that bound the unauthenticated
   pre-filter's CPU cost (see Threat Model, resource side-channel) cannot
   currently be tuned per deployment without a code change.
4. **Mid-connection retired connection IDs are pruned only when the
   connection closes.** quinn-proto 0.11 exposes no hook for observing
   per-CID retirement mid-connection (only whole-connection loss), so the
   server's CID→connection routing set grows with every CID a live connection
   is issued and only shrinks when that connection ends. Memory use is
   bounded by `live connections × CIDs issued per connection`, which is small
   in practice, but it is not the tightest possible bound.

   There is also a byte-emission (not just memory) facet: because a
   retired-but-not-yet-pruned CID stays in the active routing set until the
   connection closes, an **on-path** adversary who has already captured a live
   connection's CIDs could send a packet to a retired CID and elicit a
   stateless reset from the server. This is strictly within the documented
   on-path threat boundary — it requires having observed the connection's live
   CIDs in the first place, so it is out of scope for the scanner / off-path
   model this library defends against — but it is worth calling out explicitly
   because it is a case where the server *does* emit bytes.

5. **Handshake loss-recovery leans on the server's PTO, not the client's
   Initial retransmits.** For a given connection attempt the client fixes its
   selector DCID (and therefore the nonce/freshness embedded in it), so every
   Initial the client sends during that attempt carries the *same* (nonce,
   freshness) pair. The server's replay guard records that pair on first sight
   and drops every subsequent datagram carrying it — which includes the
   client's own Initial *retransmits*. Handshakes still converge (they rely on
   the server's PTO-driven retransmissions of its own handshake flight rather
   than on the client re-driving its Initial), but robustness under heavy
   early-flight packet loss is reduced relative to stock QUIC.

   The naive "fix" — making the selector DCID an *active* routing target after
   admission so same-flight retransmits pass through — is **unsafe** and is
   deliberately not implemented: it would let a captured Initial be replayed to
   elicit a response, breaking the silence contract. A future refinement could
   allow same-source in-progress retransmits without weakening replay
   protection, but that requires careful design and is out of scope for v1.

## Non-goals (v1)

- **No HTTP/3.** Standard QUIC stays on the wire specifically so an
  off-the-shelf HTTP/3 stack can be layered on top later via
  `Connection::quinn_connection()` without touching the cloaking layer. This is
  a supported *future direction*, not a drop-in today: the `QuinnHandle`
  currently exposes only bidirectional-stream commands, whereas h3 additionally
  requires unidirectional streams (for its control stream and QPACK
  encoder/decoder). Adding those uni-stream commands to the handle is the
  remaining work; it stays confined to the handle and does not disturb the
  silence-critical routing.
- **No certificate-based authentication.** PSK only; the TLS certificate is a
  throwaway self-signed identity and is not part of the trust model.
