//! Per-connection state: one `quinn_proto::Connection` plus the stream
//! bookkeeping needed to serve **non-blocking** stream operations.
//!
//! # Why this is not `src/conn.rs`
//!
//! The tokio wrapper's `ConnState` does the same job, but every operation there
//! is *completable later*: a read that finds no data parks a `PendingRead` with
//! a `oneshot::Sender` and the driver fires it once FIN arrives. That design
//! needs channels, and channels need a runtime.
//!
//! The core cannot wait for anything, so it does not try to. Every operation
//! here answers immediately with what is true right now:
//!
//! | old (`src/conn.rs`)                | core                            |
//! |------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
//! | park a `PendingRead`, reply on FIN | return [`ReadOutcome::Blocked`] |
//! | park a `PendingWrite`, resume on `Writable` | return [`WriteOutcome::Blocked`] |
//! | park a `pending_accept` oneshot    | return `Ok(None)`               |
//! | `fail_all()` wakes parked senders  | nothing is parked; nothing to wake |
//!
//! Waiting is the caller's job, and the caller is the one who owns a way to
//! wait: a tokio task parks on the `Blocked`, a hand-rolled `select()` loop goes
//! back around its poll set. Both are told *when* to retry by the
//! [`crate::outcome::Event`] stream that [`ConnState::service_streams`] feeds.
//!
//! # `service_streams` is the sole `poll()` caller
//!
//! `quinn_proto::Connection::poll()` *consumes* events, so exactly one place may
//! drain it or events are lost. That place is [`ConnState::service_streams`],
//! which reacts to what it can (queueing peer-opened streams for `accept_bi`)
//! and hands the rest back as a [`ConnProgress`] for the endpoint to translate
//! into [`crate::outcome::Event`]s.
