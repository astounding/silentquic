//! The sans-IO endpoint: a cloaked QUIC state machine the caller drives.
//!
//! Nothing here performs I/O, spawns, blocks, or reads the monotonic clock. The
//! caller owns the socket and passes `now` explicitly, which is what makes
//! quietquic embeddable in a hand-rolled event loop (see
//! `examples/poll_loop.rs`).
//!
//! # The silence invariant
//!
//! **A datagram that fails the cloaking pre-filter queues nothing to send.**
//!
//! [`Endpoint::handle_datagram`] runs the full pre-filter — rate limiter,
//! long-header parse, exact selector length, PSK selector match, freshness,
//! anti-replay — *before* the datagram is allowed anywhere near quinn-proto. A
//! packet that fails any of those gates returns from `handle_datagram` without
//! ever reaching quinn-proto, so nothing can have been queued: a caller
//! who faithfully drains [`Endpoint::poll_transmit`] still emits zero bytes to
//! an unauthorized peer. Invisibility is therefore a property of this API, not
//! of the caller's control flow — a C-style embedder cannot reply by mistake.
//!
//! The invariant is about pre-filter *rejection*, not about the
//! [`DatagramOutcome::Dropped`] return value. `Dropped` is the wider category
//! "this datagram produced no connection handle for you", and a datagram that
//! *passed* the pre-filter can legitimately be `Dropped` while still queuing an
//! endpoint-level response — the reachable case is a peer that proved PSK
//! possession but asked for a QUIC version we do not speak, which earns a
//! Version Negotiation packet. That peer is authorized, so answering it does not
//! break silence. See [`DatagramOutcome::Dropped`].
//!
//! # The driving contract
//!
//! One pass of a caller's loop looks like this, and **the order matters**:
//!
//! ```text
//! // 1. feed every inbound datagram
//! ep.handle_datagram(now, from, &pkt);
//! // 2. service the timer deadline, if it is due
//! if ep.next_timeout().is_some_and(|t| t <= now) { ep.handle_timeout(now) }
//! // 3. drain ALL events, doing the caller's stream work as they arrive
//! while let Some(e) = ep.poll_event() { react(e) /* stream_read / stream_write / ... */ }
//! // 4. drain ALL transmits — LAST, after every stream operation of this pass
//! while let Some(t) = ep.poll_transmit(now) { send_to(&t.contents, t.destination) }
//! // 5. only now is the deadline meaningful
//! sleep_until(ep.next_timeout());
//! ```
//!
//! Two obligations, both load-bearing:
//!
//! * **[`Endpoint::poll_transmit`] must be drained to `None`, and it must come
//!   after the caller's stream work.** It is the only method that services
//!   connections lazily, so a caller who stops early — or who drains transmits
//!   *before* calling `stream_read`/`stream_write` — leaves stream bytes and
//!   flow-control credit unsent. Draining first is the classic sans-IO stall:
//!   the credit a `stream_read` released never reaches the peer, the peer stays
//!   blocked, nothing arrives to wake the loop, and the connection hangs until
//!   the idle timeout.
//! * **[`Endpoint::next_timeout`] is read last.** It is refreshed by every
//!   servicing pass, so it only reflects the current pass once `poll_transmit`
//!   has returned `None`.
//!
//! The first obligation is also enforced rather than merely documented: any
//! caller-side stream operation that can produce something to send marks its
//! connection *dirty*, and while any connection is dirty `next_timeout()`
//! returns an already-elapsed deadline. A caller that gets the order wrong and
//! sleeps on that value wakes immediately instead of sleeping through the stall.
