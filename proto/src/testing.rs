//! In-memory scaffolding for driving a **cloaked** client/server pair with no
//! sockets, no runtime, and no threads.
//!
//! [`Pair`] wires two real [`Endpoint`]s to each other through `VecDeque<Vec<u8>>`
//! queues instead of UDP: [`Endpoint::poll_transmit`] output on one side becomes
//! [`Endpoint::handle_datagram`] input on the other, and
//! [`Endpoint::poll_event`] is drained into per-side buffers a test can inspect.
//! Every datagram therefore travels the genuine path — blinded selector DCID,
//! PSK-derived Initial keys, freshness and replay gates, rate limiter, CID
//! routing — so a handshake here proves the same thing a loopback handshake
//! would, minus the flakiness.
//!
//! # Why this is public
//!
//! It is not gated behind a `testing` feature, for two reasons. First, a feature
//! only this crate's own integration tests could turn on would need a
//! self-referential dev-dependency to work — real complexity for no benefit.
//! Second, the audience is wider than this crate: quietquic's whole point is
//! that an embedder can drive the core from a hand-rolled event loop, and an
//! embedder who does that needs a way to test their loop against a live peer
//! without opening a socket. [`Pair`] is that.
//!
//! Nothing here is on any production path, and nothing in the core depends on
//! it. It is also the only place in this crate that reads a clock on behalf of a
//! caller: [`connected_pair`] seeds the monotonic epoch with `Instant::now()`
//! ([`connected_pair_at`] lets a caller supply it instead), and [`Pair::new_at`]
//! passes [`crate::freshness::now_minutes()`] to
//! [`Endpoint::new_client`] as the selector's freshness minute. Both are
//! legitimate precisely because a test harness *is* the caller that owns the
//! clocks. The freshness minute has to be the real one here, because the
//! server's pre-filter checks it against the real wall clock.
